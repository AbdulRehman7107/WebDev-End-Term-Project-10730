# WebDev-End-Term-Project
# 🧠 BrainBlitz

## Project Description
**BrainBlitz** is a browser-based mini game platform developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The application offers interactive games designed to improve **memory, reaction time, and mental calculation speed**, while demonstrating core web development concepts such as **DOM manipulation, event handling, and real-time UI updates**.

The project runs entirely on the client side and does not require any external libraries or frameworks.

## Problem Statement
6️⃣ Entertainment, Games & Engagement Platforms
Many beginner web development projects lack meaningful user interaction and real-time behavior.  
The objective of this project is to build an engaging web application that demonstrates:

- Dynamic content rendering without page reloads  
- Real-time user interaction handling  
- Efficient use of JavaScript to control UI behavior  

BrainBlitz solves this by combining multiple interactive games into a single, responsive web interface.

## DOM Concepts Used

- **DOM Selection**  
  `getElementById()`, `querySelector()`

- **Dynamic Element Creation**  
  `createElement()`, `appendChild()`

- **Event Handling**  
  `addEventListener()` for clicks and interactions

- **Class Manipulation**  
  `classList.add()`, `classList.remove()`

- **Real-time DOM Updates**  
  `innerHTML` updates based on game state

- **Timers and Intervals**  
  `setTimeout()`, `setInterval()`, `clearInterval()`

- **Performance Measurement**  
  `performance.now()` for reaction time calculation

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Download or clone the project files.
2. Ensure the following files are in the same folder:
   - `index.html`
   - `style.css`
   - `script.js`
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
4. Select a game from the menu to begin playing.

No server setup or installation is required.

## Known Limitations

- No persistent score storage (data resets on page refresh)
- No user authentication system
- Limited sound and animation effects
- Designed primarily for desktop and tablet screens
